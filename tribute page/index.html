            <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
            <p>Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, widely known as A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, was not only a brilliant scientist but also a deeply respected humanitarian, educator, and visionary leader. Born into a modest Muslim family in the temple town of Rameswaram on October 15, 1931, Kalam's early life was shaped by discipline, strong values, and a thirst for knowledge. Despite financial hardships, he supported his education by distributing newspapers and remained a bright student throughout. His determination led him to graduate in aerospace engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology, a turning point that would shape India’s future in science and defense.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kalam’s contribution to India’s defense and space technology is unparalleled. He played a key role in the development of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III), which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in 1980, placing India among elite space powers. At the DRDO and later at ISRO, his leadership and vision propelled India’s missile programs, leading to the successful development of strategic missiles such as Agni and Prithvi. He also served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the DRDO during the 1998 Pokhran nuclear tests, which marked India’s emergence as a nuclear state.</p>
            <p>However, what made Dr. Kalam truly beloved was not just his scientific brilliance but his humility, simplicity, and his unwavering faith in the youth. In 2002, he was elected as the 11th President of India, where he earned the nickname “People’s President” due to his accessibility and sincere efforts to connect with the public, especially students. He believed that true progress could only be achieved through education, innovation, and moral strength. A prolific writer and motivational speaker, his books like Wings of Fire, Ignited Minds, and India 2020 continue to inspire generations. Even after his presidency, he remained active in education, traveling tirelessly to meet young minds and encourage them to dream big.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong, symbolizing his lifelong dedication to teaching and learning. He left behind a legacy of scientific excellence, patriotism, and an undying message: “Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action.” His life continues to be a beacon of inspiration for every Indian striving to serve the nation with knowledge, courage, and compassion.</p>
